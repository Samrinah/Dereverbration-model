Fine-tuned the SGMSE speech enhancement model using a custom dataset generated by combining cleaned speech audio with Room Impulse Responses (RIRs) to simulate realistic noisy environments. The dataset consisted of paired clean and noisy WAV files with consistent sampling rates. By leveraging a pretrained checkpoint and optimized training parameters, speech quality was significantly improved, increasing the DNSMOS score from 2.25 to 3.53.
